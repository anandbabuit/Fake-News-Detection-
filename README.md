**A Hybrid Framework for Fake News Detection Using Transformer Models with MASHAP**

Step 1: Set Up the Environment

•	Install required libraries (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, Transformers, SHAP, OpenCV, etc.)

•	Import all necessary libraries

Step 2: Load and Preprocess Datasets

•	Load the MediaEval, CASIA, and Weibo datasets

•	Split into train, validation, and test sets

•	Separate text and image components

•	Apply any needed data cleaning on text

Step 3: Preprocess Images

•	Apply Error Level Analysis (ELA) to highlight tampered regions

•	Resize and normalize images for EfficientNetB0 input

Step 4: Text Feature Extraction

•	Load pre-trained XLNet and ELECTRA models

•	Tokenize and encode text inputs

•	Extract embeddings or fine-tune for feature representation

Step 5: Visual Feature Extraction

•	Load EfficientNetB0 pre-trained model

•	Pass ELA-processed images through EfficientNet to extract features


Step 6: Classification for Each Modality

•	Train or fine-tune individual classifiers:

o	Text classifier with XLNet

o	Text classifier with ELECTRA

o	Image classifier with EfficientNetB0

Step 7: Ensemble Soft Voting

•	Combine outputs from all classifiers using soft voting (weighted average of probabilities)

•	Generate final prediction

Step 8: Explainability with MASHAP

•	Use SHAP to compute Shapley values for each modality

•	Visualize and interpret the most influential features from both text and image

Step 9: Evaluation

•	Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score

•	Compare results across all three datasets

Step 10: Visualization and Reporting

•	Plot confusion matrices

•	Display SHAP summary plots for interpretability

•	Present performance metrics per dataset
